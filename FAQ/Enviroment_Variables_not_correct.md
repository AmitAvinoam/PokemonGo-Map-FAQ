Luckily for you, this error is easy to solve!

###What's wrong:
Windows defines commands in something called "enviroment variables", if a program isn't here, Windwos doesn't understand what you mean.
###How to solve this:
If you install python, it can automatically set the correct enviroment variables. However, if you didn't enable this feature, you need to do it manually.
###How to set them manually:
Step 1]	Press the WindowsKey + Pause/Break (Or rightclick on "This PC" and select properties)
